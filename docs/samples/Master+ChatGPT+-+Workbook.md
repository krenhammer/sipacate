Describe the type of buyers who would purchase AnyQuest.

### **Prompt 2 - Buyer Persona 1 Pagers**

Please make buyer persona 1 pagers out of these

Create 3 personas involved in the sales cycle for purchasing enterprise AI enablement from AnyQuest:

3.  Skeptic – concerned about cost, complexity, or risk.

For each, include job title, motivations, concerns, and what kind of messaging would resonate with them.

### **Prompt 4 - Writing Web Copy**

Now think about how to write web copy that speaks to this audience — buyers at $1M–$1B companies who are scaling AI internally. Focus on clarity, outcomes, and how AnyQuest simplifies AI adoption with multi-step agents, tool integrations, and retrieval-augmented generation. What tone, structure, and messaging would resonate most? Add a section to each of the 3 personas.

## Lecture 5: Defining Brand Voice & Writing Style

## **Prompt Chain: Brand Voice Guidelines**

### **Prompt 1 - Persona and Product Analysis**

I’ve uploaded information about our company, our ideal customer, and our personas. I want you to help me build a writing guide to inform the tone, style, and content of a custom GPT so that the GPT produces content that will align with the problems we solve, who we solve them for, and how they want to read about this information. Please analyze.

### **Prompt 2 - Tone, Structure, and Messaging**

### **Prompt 3 - Ask ChatGPT for a prompt**

Now I want you to build a detailed prompt to use to get chatGPT to write in this way. Derive a brand voice and refine.

### **Prompt 4 - AI Tell Tales**

How much do you know about the telltale signs of AI written copy?

### **Prompt 5 - Update Brand Voice**

Use what you just answered to build brand voice guidelines that will work to make a customer chatgpt work better. Give me 10 or 15 rules I can add to the brand voice section.

### **Prompt 6 - Finalize Document**

Use the information we’ve discussed, including our company positioning, ideal customer profile, key buyer personas, and brand tone, to create a **Brand Voice Guidelines** document for a custom GPT.

The GPT will be used to write persuasive, high-converting web copy for our company. The goal is to ensure that the AI consistently writes like a skilled, native English-speaking copywriter who understands our buyers, business challenges, and how to communicate value clearly and confidently.

Include the following in the Brand Voice Guidelines:

\- Audience & Buyer Personas

\- Tone of Voice

\- Writing Style Rules

\- Anti-AI-Writing Filters
