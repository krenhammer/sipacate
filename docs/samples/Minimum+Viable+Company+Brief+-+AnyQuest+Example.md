## Lesson 1: Minimum Viable Company Brief (AnyQuest Example)

Instructor: Dan Wilson

### Who are you for?

Companies with $1M–$1B in revenue that have started using AI tools internally but need help scaling AI workflows across teams. Common buyers are in SaaS, logistics, professional services, or other mid-market to lower-enterprise orgs. Ideal personas include: CIOs, Heads of Ops, Innovation Leaders, AI Champions, and skeptical CFOs or IT stakeholders.

### What do you offer?

A no-code/low-code AI enablement platform that lets organizations build, deploy, and scale multi-step AI agents that integrate with their existing tools. It simplifies AI adoption by eliminating manual prompt work, enabling agent-to-agent workflows, and centralizing knowledge via retrieval-augmented generation.

### When do they need you?

When they’ve experimented with ChatGPT or AI tools, but workflows are manual, inconsistent, or siloed. Often under pressure from leadership to make AI more productive and want to reduce reliance on a few technical experts. Buying is triggered by internal pilots stalling, inconsistent output, or unmet AI scaling goals.

### How do you help?

*   Visual agent builder (multi-step workflows)
*   Integrations with Slack, email, and APIs
*   Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for internal knowledge reuse
*   Hosting, summarizing, and searching internal content
*   Cross-agent communication to maintain consistent outputs
*   Extend LLMs with tools like web search, scraping, etc.

### Why does it matter?

Customers want to move beyond AI experimentation into consistent, scalable, and secure automation. They want to empower teams (not just experts) to use AI, reduce manual effort, and speed up research, content generation, or internal processes — all while ensuring reliable, compliant, and cost-effective outcomes.

### Messaging Pillars

*   No-code AI workflows for operations, support, and product teams.
*   Go from idea to deployed AI workflow in under an hour.
*   Connect to your tools, databases, content, systems, and APIs.
*   Build Agents that understand your data, customers, and processes
*   Turn AI into a process you can trust and scale.
*   Build once, reuse everywhere
