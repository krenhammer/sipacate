      # Research Methodology Guide

      ## Introduction to Research Methods
      
      This guide provides an overview of common research methodologies used in academic contexts.
      
      ## Quantitative Research
      
      Quantitative research involves the collection and analysis of numerical data. It typically follows these steps:
      
      1. Defining the research question
      2. Formulating hypotheses
      3. Collecting data through surveys, experiments, or observations
      4. Analyzing data using statistical methods
      5. Drawing conclusions and reporting findings
      
      ### Common Statistical Methods
      
      - Descriptive statistics: mean, median, mode, standard deviation
      - Inferential statistics: t-tests, ANOVA, regression analysis
      - Factor analysis and cluster analysis
      
      ## Qualitative Research
      
      Qualitative research focuses on understanding phenomena through:
      
      - Interviews
      - Focus groups
      - Participant observation
      - Document analysis
      
      ### Analysis Approaches
      
      - Thematic analysis
      - Grounded theory
      - Narrative analysis
      - Discourse analysis
      
      ## Mixed Methods
      
      Mixed methods research combines both quantitative and qualitative approaches to provide a more comprehensive understanding of research problems.

      # Literature Review Best Practices
      
      ## Purpose of Literature Reviews
      
      A literature review serves several important purposes in academic research:
      
      - Establishes what is already known about a topic
      - Identifies research gaps
      - Places your research within a scholarly context
      - Demonstrates your knowledge of the field
      
      ## Steps in Conducting a Literature Review
      
      1. **Define your research question**
         Clearly articulate what you want to know.
      
      2. **Search for relevant literature**
         Use academic databases, Google Scholar, and library resources.
      
      3. **Evaluate and select sources**
         Assess relevance, credibility, and recency.
      
      4. **Analyze and synthesize**
         Identify themes, controversies, and gaps.
      
      5. **Organize your review**
         Structure can be chronological, thematic, methodological, or theoretical.
      
      6. **Write the review**
         Present a coherent narrative of the literature.
      
      ## Common Mistakes to Avoid
      
      - Simply summarizing sources without synthesis
      - Including irrelevant literature
      - Over-relying on secondary sources
      - Misrepresenting authors' findings
      - Not critiquing the literature
      
      ## Types of Literature Reviews
      
      - Narrative reviews
      - Systematic reviews
      - Meta-analyses
      - Scoping reviews
      - Integrative reviews
