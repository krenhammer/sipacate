      # Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Strategy Guide

      ## What is an MVP?
      
      An MVP is the version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future development. The key principles are:
      
      - Focus on core functionality that solves the primary customer problem
      - Build quickly and efficiently with minimal resources
      - Learn from real user feedback to guide future iterations
      - Validate product-market fit before full investment
      
      ## Designing Sipacate's MVP
      
      For Sipacate's platform, the MVP should focus on:
      
      ### Core Features
      
      1. **Assistant Creation Tool**
         - Basic assistant customization
         - File upload for knowledge base
         - Simple prompt engineering interface
      
      2. **Plan Template Builder**
         - Basic template creation
         - Step sequencing functionality
         - Simple sharing capabilities
      
      3. **User Management**
         - Simple organization structure
         - Basic role-based permissions
         - Invitation system for team members
      
      ### MVP Success Metrics
      
      - **User Engagement**: Weekly active users, feature usage rates
      - **Retention**: 30-day retention rate for early adopters
      - **Feedback Quality**: Actionable insights from user feedback
      - **Time-to-Value**: How quickly users achieve their first success
      - **Technical Performance**: System stability and response times
      
      ## Iterative Development Plan
      
      ### Phase 1: MVP Launch
      - Release core functionality
      - Onboard initial beta users
      - Collect usage data and feedback
      
      ### Phase 2: Rapid Iteration
      - Weekly sprints based on user feedback
      - Prioritize features that address common pain points
      - Improve UX based on observed user behavior
      
      ### Phase 3: Expansion
      - Add secondary feature sets
      - Explore integration opportunities
      - Refine pricing model based on value metrics
      
      ## Common MVP Pitfalls to Avoid
      
      - Feature creep: Adding "nice-to-have" features before validating core functionality
      - Perfectionism: Delaying launch to polish features that aren't critical
      - Ignoring feedback: Not acting on early user insights
      - Poor onboarding: Making it difficult for early users to get started
      - Undefined success criteria: Not knowing what "success" looks like for your MVP
