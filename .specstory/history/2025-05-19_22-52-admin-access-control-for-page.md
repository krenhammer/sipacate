The `GetStartedPage` now only displays if the user is an admin. If the user is not an admin, a centered message "You do not have access to this page." is shown instead. This uses the `useAdminStatus` hook from your existing auth hooks.

If you need a redirect instead of a message, or want to customize the experience further, let me know!
